#Link Ninja

Link Ninja is a browser extension that allows you easily select multiple links by opening a selection rectangle with your mouse. 

Once your selection is complete a configurable action can be applied to the result.
Available actions include: open in tabs, open in tabs on demand (ie: load tab contents when clicking the tab), open in tabs deferred (ie: delay between each tab opening), copy to clipboard (allowing custom formatting), and bookmark.

You can also set up targeting rules in order to restrict the link elements available for selection. Targeting rules can be configured by specifying a CSS selector (ex: .someclass) or URL pattern (ex: \*.google.com/\*).
