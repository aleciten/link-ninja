#Link Ninja

Link Ninja is a browser extension that allows you to swiftly select multiple links by opening a selection rectangle with your mouse. Once your selection is complete a configurable action can be applied to the result.

Available actions are: open in tabs, open in tabs on demand (ie: load tab contents only after selecting the tab), open in tabs deferred (ie: delay between each tab opening), copy to clipboard (allowing custom formatting), and bookmark.

Targeting rules can be set up to restrict link elements available for selection, and can be configured by specifying a CSS selector or URL pattern.
